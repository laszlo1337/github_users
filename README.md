# github_users

This is the app I've made to learn a little bit of Retrofit, Glide, Gson etc. The main screen uses RecyclerView
to display GitHub users in endless list from github API, when User is clicked, a new activity is started. It displays
user repositories with the help of Fragments, that are aggregated in ViewPager with TabLayout. Layout needs redesign
